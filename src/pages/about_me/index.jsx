              Fawaz Oyedeji is a documentary photographer, photojournalist, and
              historian from Nigeria whose work centers on exploring political
              expression in Africa. His work examines how people interact with
              power, understanding it not just as a repressive force but as one
              that operates actively within various levels of social structures,
              such as political authority, social class, institutions, and
              events.

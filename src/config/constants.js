          mission encompassed collaboration with a broad spectrum of

          Hidden Flows is an exhibition that aims to shed light on the often
          unseen dynamics of resources, infrastructure, and services in African
          cities. Through the lens of urban metabolism, we explore how resources
          flow within these cities, providing valuable insights for
          decision-makers and policy development. Unlike traditional research
          that relies on extensive quantitative data, we focus on the unique
          challenges faced in African contexts, where resources follow
          decentralized systems and involve informal networks.
          <div className="mt-5">

            The images featured in the exhibition have been captured under the
            commission from ICLEI Local Government For Sustainability.

          Every four years, when elections are approaching, thousands and
          thousands of party-political posters start to invade our cityscape.
          This has become almost a campaign weapon for parties" rivalries over
          urban space and for politicians to demonstrate their power and
          demarcate their territories. It is a visual performance of power.
        </div>
        <div className="mt-4">
          In this work, I delve into the role of political posters in everyday
          party politicking in Nigeria, where they have become an almost normal
          or naturalized habitual repertoire of political action.
        </div>
        <div className="mt-4">
          Printing in Nigeria is a growing industry that is becoming
          increasingly important to political culture. It is worth millions,
          despite still using artisanal methods in most places.  Posters,
          banners, and billboards are never big enough for politicians to
          impregnate our minds with their electoral ambition. Campaign after
          campaign, the posters are twice as large, twice as tall, and always
          more dominant than the previous one.

        <div className="mt-4 mb-4">
          The candidates want to convince voters that they would be the best
          choice to run their life, through portraits that mimic historical and
          reassuring political leaders, either smiling or with emotionless
          faces. For the few months of the campaign, they are everywhere, on
          every corner, every street or bridge, and major road. We, as citizens,
          experience the hyper-visibility of politics before the images tarnish
          and the promises fade.

          After years of experiencing political corruption, human rights violation, and extortion within the SARS [Special Anti Robbery Squad] unit of the police force, young Nigerians are determined to reform the policing system through a series of peaceful nationwide protests until their demands are met.


        </div>
        <div className="mt-4">
          The #EndSARS protest which started as a peaceful demonstration by thousands of youths quickly degenerated into chaos as security forces, mostly police began to use live ammunition and tear gas on protesters leading to an estimated death of at least 100 individuals. 48 of whom were killed on October 20, 2020, alone.

        </div>
        <div className="mt-4">
          Despite a system that has been unresponsive to their need, the youth of Nigeria have spoken up. There is poetry to the fact that the protest erupted in October 2020. Oct. 1, 1960, marked the official date of Nigeria’s independence from British rule. Sixty years later, Nigerians are still demanding freedom from repression.

          It is common for Western charities to collect used clothes and ship
          them to Africa as aid. But these goods, discarded by well-intentioned
          Americans and Europeans, are rarely given as charity; instead, the
          donations are mostly sold to exporters who make huge profits selling
          second-hand goods in markets all over the continent. While some
          African countries have banned the importation of thrift clothes in a
          bid to protect local clothing and textile industries, in Nigeria the
          second-hand clothing industry – worth an estimated 148USD$ million –
          is booming.
        </div>
        <div className="mt-4">
          Nigeria’s growing resale market can be traced back to the 1950s and
          1960s. Then, Okrika, Rivers State, was the only port where used
          clothes from Europe could come through. Na mumu dey go boutique
          loosely translates to “only fools shop at boutiques.” These words are
          the chorus to a bustling market in Yaba, Lagos, Nigeria, sung by
          sellers of Okrika (second-hand clothing). Moreso, these words are a
          perception that much of the general populace holds regarding pre-owned
          pieces. Recent figures from the UN show that an estimated 80% of
          Africans wear secondhand clothing.

          With the undeniable effects of fast fashion on global warming, it has
          become paramount to engage the masses about employing sustainable
          homegrown solutions to bypass the challenges of cloth production
          through a medium they can easily understand. It is my goal, not only
          to highlight the immense environmental complexities associated with
          the second-hand clothing industry but also the unique ecosystem
          involved with such a sector of the economy through the eyes of these

          "Otto Daily" explores the complexities around how historical patterns
          like migration and religion, have reconfigured the identity of the
          indigenous Otto community in Lagos, Nigeria.
        </div>
        <div className="mt-4">
          Otto is located in the south of Oyingbo, Lagos. Prior to the sixteenth
          century a number of Awori,the southernmost of the Yoruba speaking
          people dispersed from Isheri, a village twelve miles upthe Ogun River,
          seeking refuge from conflict. A group of them settled in modern-day
          Lagos. Therethey established three main settlements, Iddo, Lagos
          Island, and Otto. Overtime, Iddo and LagosIsland both expanded into a
          major international metropolitan trading centers.
        </div>
        <div className="mt-4 mb-4">
          However, the Otto settlement still retains much of its and communal
          identity and domestic form of trade. This settlement has a tradition
          of origin that has been kept alive till today. Although mainly
          occupied by Yorubas, their customs and traditions have been redefined
          with distinct customsthrough the influx of people from neighboring
          states and the Nigerian hinterland.<div className="mt-4">"2018"</div>

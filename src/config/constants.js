        description:"Gun for hire: Nigeria security fears spark boom in private protection - Many guards for wealthy and middle-class people are hired police officers. In October 2021, I documented the private security landscape in Lagos for the Financial Times. The article sheds light on the prevalence of private security services in Nigeria, with an estimated 40% of the country's police officers working for these firms. The demand for such services has surged in response to the worsening security situation across the nation. Here is the link to the article: Gun for hire.",

        description:'Hidden Flows is an exhibition that aims to shed light on the often unseen dynamics of resources, infrastructure, and services in African cities. Through the lens of urban metabolism, we explore how resources flow within these cities, providing valuable insights for decision-makers and policy development. Unlike traditional research that relies on extensive quantitative data, we focus on the unique challenges faced in African contexts, where resources follow decentralized systems and involve informal networks. The images featured in the exhibition have been captured under the commission from ICLEI Local Government For Sustainability To experience the "Hidden Flows" exhibition and gain a deeper understanding of the intricate resource dynamics in African cities, visit the following link: Hidden Flows Exhibition.',

Unlike traditional research that relies on extensive quantitative data, we focus on the unique challenges faced in African contexts, where resources follow decentralized systems and involve informal networks.<div className="mt-5"> The images featured in the exhibition have been captured under the commission from ICLEI Local Government For Sustainability.</div><div className="mt-4">To experience the "Hidden Flows" exhibition and gain a deeper understanding of the intricate resource dynamics in African cities, visit the following link: <a href="https://www.thenatureofcities.com/hidden-flows-rise-africa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="Hidden Flows">Hidden Flows Exhibition.</a></div></div></div>,

It is worth millions, despite still using artisanal methods in most places.  Posters, banners, and billboards are never big enough for politicians to impregnate our minds with their electoral ambition. Campaign after campaign, the posters are twice as large, twice as tall, and always more dominant than the previous one. </div><div className="mt-4">The candidates want to convince voters that they would be the best choice to run their life, through portraits that mimic historical and reassuring political leaders, either smiling or with emotionless faces. For the few months of the campaign, they are everywhere, on every corner, every street or bridge, and major road. We, as citizens, experience the hyper-visibility of politics before the images tarnish and the promises fade.</div></div>,

            <div><div>"Otto Daily" explores the complexities around how historical patterns like migration and religion, have reconfigured the identity of the indigenous Otto community in Lagos, Nigeria.</div><div  className="mt-4">Otto is located in the south of Oyingbo, Lagos. Prior to the sixteenth century a number of Awori,the southernmost of the Yoruba speaking people dispersed from Isheri, a village twelve miles upthe Ogun River, seeking refuge from conflict. A group of them settled in modern-day Lagos. Therethey established three main settlements, Iddo, Lagos Island, and Otto. Overtime, Iddo and LagosIsland both expanded into a major international metropolitan trading centers.</div><div className="mt-4">However, the Otto settlement still retains much of its and communal identity and domestic form of trade. This settlement has a tradition of origin that has been kept alive till today. Although mainly occupied by Yorubas, their customs and traditions have been redefined with distinct customsthrough the influx of people from neighboring states and the Nigerian hinterland.<div className="mt-4">"2018"</div></div></div>,

            <div><div>It is common for Western charities to collect used clothes and ship them to Africa as aid. But these goods, discarded by well-intentioned Americans and Europeans, are rarely given as charity; instead, the donations are mostly sold to exporters who make huge profits selling second-hand goods in markets all over the continent. While some African countries have banned the importation of thrift clothes in a bid to protect local clothing and textile industries, in Nigeria the second-hand clothing industry – worth an estimated 148USD$ million – is booming.</div><div className="mt-5">Nigeria’s growing resale market can be traced back to the 1950s and 1960s. Then, Okrika, Rivers State, was the only port where used clothes from Europe could come through. Na mumu dey go boutique loosely translates to “only fools shop at boutiques.” These words are the chorus to a bustling market in Yaba, Lagos, Nigeria, sung by sellers of Okrika (second-hand clothing). Moreso, these words are a perception that much of the general populace holds regarding pre-owned pieces. Recent figures from the UN show that an estimated 80% of Africans wear secondhand clothing.</div><div className="mt-4">With the undeniable effects of fast fashion on global warming, it has become paramount to engage the masses about employing sustainable homegrown solutions to bypass the challenges of cloth production through a medium they can easily understand. It is my goal, not only to highlight the immense environmental complexities associated with the second-hand clothing industry but also the unique ecosystem involved with such a sector of the economy through the eyes of these traders.</div></div>,
